*funq* project
--------------

**funq** is a tool to write FUNctional tests for Qt applications
using python.

It is licenced under the CeCILL v2.1 licence (very close to the GPL v2).
See the LICENCE.txt file distributed in the sources for more information.

How does *funq* works
---------------------

**funq** is divided in two parts:

- **funq-server** is the server part of the project, composed of an
  executable called **funq** and a dynamic library **libFunq**. The
  **funq** executable allows to inject some code in a QT application
  to start a TCP server that will allow to interact with the application.

- **funq** is a python package that offers an API to interact with a
  **libFunq** TCP server. It is the client side of the project, and uses
  nosetests to launch FUNctional Qt tests.

Installation
------------

**funq-server** contains c++ code that need compilation. You can install it
with python like this::
  
  cd server
  sudo python setup.py install

Or for the framework developers::
  
  cd server
  sudo python setup.py develop
  
  # the command `sudo python setup.py develop` must be launched each time
  # the C++ code will change

.. note::
  
  **funq-server** needs some work under windows. It appears that it may currently
  works with mingw-32 under windows xp, but it's waiting for contributors
  to help !

The **funq** package is a pure python package and install can be easily
done with the following command::
  
  cd client
  python setup.py install

Or for the framework developers::
  
  cd client
  python setup.py develop
